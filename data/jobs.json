Transparency here can significantly improve your application rate.\r\n*   **Description:** I've fleshed out the description based on common entry-level customer service roles in the telecommunications industry.  Adjust this to match the *actual* responsibilities and requirements of the role.  Is it a call center role?  Does it involve field work?  Does it require specific technical skills?  The more detail you provide, the better.\r\n*   **Company Culture:** Consider adding a brief paragraph about your company's culture and values. This helps attract candidates who are a good fit for your team.\r\n*   **Etisalat Relationship:** Be clear about the relationship with etisalat. Are you a direct employee, a contractor, a partner, etc.? This is important for candidates to understand.\r\n\r\nBy filling in the missing information and tailoring the description to the specific role, you'll create a much more effective job posting that attracts qualified candidates.
